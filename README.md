# Machine-Learning
This repository contains ML tasks that was done throughout the Lun ML course and also the project itself.
The purpose of the project was to collect own dataset, which describes housing rental prices in Kiev and 
using regression analysis techniques learn to predict these prices. In my project, I used both progressive library methods
and basic regression analysis techniques written on my own.
